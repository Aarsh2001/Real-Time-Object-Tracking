# Real-Time-Object-Tracking
Computer vision at its core is about making an understanding through visual data. Object Detection , one of the fundamental techniques is about localising an object in space and drawing bounding boxes around it.


Video allows for deeper situational understanding, because sequences of images provide new information about action. For example, we can track an obstacle through a sequence of images and understand its behavior to predict the next move. We can track a human pose, and understand the action taken with action classification.
