# Real-Time-Object-Tracking
**Computer vision** at its core is about making an understanding through visual data.We detect obstacles, segment images, or extract relevant context from a given scene. One particular area is **Video Analysis** , which is the primary focus behind this project. The aim is to track the obstacles in each frame.

*The pipeline is as follows Object Detection->Object Tracking(Association)-> Output*

# Object Detection
The tracking will lie heavily on the detection algorithm, so i have used yolov3 as the backbone with OpenCV engine(faster than darknet).

# Obstacle Tracking
Now comes the main part of this project, the idea behind this is to associate bounding boxes from frame t-1 to t. This task has been achieved by the **Hungarian Algorithm**, which is used for association(through a metric) and ID distribution.

# Metrics
To calculate similarity between two boxes i have considered 3 metrics based off this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.03572.pdf)-:
- IOU Score
- Sanchez Mattila Score
- Exponential Score

The id's dont change with the frames and the obstacles have been tracked.

# Problems
- Inference on YOLO is slow, if you have cuda use the following functions
```
self.net.setPreferableBackend(cv2.dnn.DNN_BACKEND_CUDA)
self.net.setPreferableTarget(cv2.dnn.DNN_TARGET_GPU)
```
- If the IOU matches and the classes are diffreent, the algorithm wont be able to distingiush between the objects

# Future Works
- Look into Compression techniques such as Pruning and Quantization. Sparse Quantized Yolo models have a very low inference time
- Implement [DeepSort](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.07402.pdf) a, CNN based metric which uses as a *Siamese Network* to account for the spatial features as well.
- For more robustness code a **Kalman Filter** to predict the next position of an obstacle along with association.
